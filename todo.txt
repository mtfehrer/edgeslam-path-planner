what is this branch used for?
1. so we can get a recording from the zed camera (and maybe play it back quickly)
2. so in the future we can run the updated edgeslam with path planning on the jetson

we don't need to worry about #2 right now, thats far away.

ok so now we need to do

1. record with zed camera
2. play back said recording

so we need a different setup for each

1. only start mobile container, have the start script run roslaunch zed_wrapper zed2.launch
2. start both containers, in the mobile container have the start script play the recording

maybe a better name for the branch would be jetson-record/playback
